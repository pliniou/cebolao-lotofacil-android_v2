    <!-- Education / Explainers -->
    <string name="edu_stats_title">Understanding Statistics</string>
    <string name="edu_section_normal_dist">Normal Distribution</string>
    <string name="edu_normal_dist_intro">The normal distribution (bell curve) describes how many random phenomena cluster around an average, with fewer occurrences at extreme values.</string>
    <string name="edu_normal_dist_history">The idea appeared in the 18th century (De Moivre and Laplace) and was popularized by Gauss when studying measurement errors. It became the basis of statistics for modeling "natural" variations and uncertainty.</string>
    <string name="edu_normal_dist_application">Here it serves as a reference: if the process is "pure chance", most results fall close to the average and extremes are rare. The dashed line shows this expectation to compare with history.</string>
    <string name="edu_normal_dist_intuition">In many draws, small variations cancel out and results tend to accumulate in the center. The further from the average, the lower the frequency — not impossible, just less common.</string>

    <string name="edu_section_filters">Filters and Distribution</string>
    <string name="edu_filters_desc">Each filter measures an aspect of the game (sum, evens, primes, etc.). In the histogram, bars show the frequency of each value in history; the higher, the more common. When available, the dashed line indicates the expected normal distribution.</string>

    <string name="edu_hot_cold_title">Frequency and Delay</string>
    <string name="edu_hot_cold_desc">"Hot" numbers appeared more in the period; "Overdue" numbers have not appeared for the longest time. This doesn\'t change the chance of the next draw (independent events), but helps balance strategies.</string>

    <string name="tap_to_collapse">Tap to collapse</string>

    <!-- Filter Explanations -->
    <string name="filter_soma_title">Sum</string>
    <string name="filter_soma_desc">Sum of all numbers in the game. Historically, the sum tends to concentrate in a central range; very low or very high values appear less frequently.</string>

    <string name="filter_pares_title">Evens</string>
    <string name="filter_pares_desc">Count of even numbers (and consequently odd numbers). History favors balance (e.g., 7/8 or 8/7); extremes are less common.</string>

    <string name="filter_primos_title">Primes</string>
    <string name="filter_primos_desc">Count of prime numbers among the 15. There are 9 primes on the card; historically, it usually stays around 4 to 6 primes per draw.</string>

    <string name="filter_moldura_title">Frame</string>
    <string name="filter_moldura_desc">Count of numbers on the frame (border) of the card. Helps avoid excessive concentrations on the border; very low or high values deviate from the most frequent pattern.</string>

    <string name="filter_retrato_title">Center</string>
    <string name="filter_retrato_desc">Count of numbers in the center (interior) of the card. It is the complement of the frame and indicates how "central" the game is.</string>

    <string name="filter_fibonacci_title">Fibonacci</string>
    <string name="filter_fibonacci_desc">Count of numbers belonging to the Fibonacci sequence present on the card (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21). Use to avoid games too "off the curve" in this set.</string>

    <string name="filter_multiplos3_title">Multiples of 3</string>
    <string name="filter_multiplos3_desc">Count of numbers multiple of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24). Balance tends to be more common than extremes.</string>

    <string name="filter_repetidas_title">Repeated</string>
    <string name="filter_repetidas_desc">How many numbers repeat relative to the last draw. generally, an intermediate number of repetitions occurs; almost none or many repetitions are less common.</string>

    <string name="filter_sequencias_title">Sequences</string>
    <string name="filter_sequencias_desc">Presence of consecutive sequences (e.g., 10–11–12). Short sequences are common; many long sequences tend to be rare.</string>

    <string name="filter_linhas_title">Rows</string>
    <string name="filter_linhas_desc">Distribution by horizontal rows. Avoid concentrating many numbers in few rows; a more balanced distribution usually appears more frequently.</string>

    <string name="filter_colunas_title">Columns</string>
    <string name="filter_colunas_desc">Distribution by vertical columns. As with rows, concentrations in few columns are less common; balance tends to be more frequent.</string>

    <string name="filter_quadrantes_title">Quadrants</string>
    <string name="filter_quadrantes_desc">Distribution between regions (quadrants) of the card. Serves to balance the game and avoid numbers being concentrated in a single area.</string>
